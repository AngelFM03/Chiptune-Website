	where you can get to know about me and this website. I made this website so that I can share my talent with the world
	rather than keeping all of this stuff private to myself and in case if anybody in the world does enjoy or want to
	download my music.<br><br><br>Also, I am not making any money or profit from the music I make and upload here and the
	only purpose of this website is purely entertainment.<br><br><br>I want to note that I do not take requests based on what
	music I should make, cover, or even how my music should sound, so I upload my music regardless of whether the listener
	enjoys it or not.<br><br><br>By the way, some of my music (mainly the covers) do come from copyrighted material but those
	are remix covers made by me and are free to listen to and download and also crediting the original composers.<br><br><br>
	Importantly, you can and are allowed to use my music in whatever your projects or videos are and you don't really have to
	ask, but I would REALLY recommend you to credit my name in your works, videos, or projects and I beg of you to NOT claim
	any of my work as your own or leave it uncredited.</b> </td>
